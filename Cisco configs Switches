# Here is a sample script for configuring a trunk between two Cisco switches, with native VLAN 100 and allowing only VLANs 1-100:
! On Switch 1:
conf t
interface FastEthernet0/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk native vlan 100
switchport trunk allowed vlan 1-100
exit

! On Switch 2:
conf t
interface FastEthernet0/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk native vlan 100
switchport trunk allowed vlan 1-100
exit
